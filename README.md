# Fall 2018

## What

Let's take a day to work on something (useful) that is not currently getting attention but is in scope for what the libraries do (or should do). The definition of usefulness is intentionally vague. A 'useful' Slack bot script seems fair game, as does experimenting with metadata cleanup, or working on a bug in your favorite open source project.

This year, we want to also introduce the possibility of working on project pitches instead of trying to knock out a bunch of code in a day. Spend the day working with peers to define a project proposal and pitch it at the end of the Days.

Serendipity Days can be an opportunity to work with colleagues your project work might not normally pair you with.

Some potential ideas for project areas could be on the topics of DISJ, Machine Learning, APIs, microdata, microformats, or something entirely different.

## When

:rocket: Noon (Lunch provided) on November 5th through 3pm (demo time) on November 6th :rainbow:

*Note:* Renee will send invites for the kickoff lunch and the demo to know how many lunches to order. Be sure to block the rest of the time on your calendar if you are planning to participate! Lunch will not be provided on November 6th as there is a CREOS Brown Bag many will likely attend.

## Who

DLS.

## Where

NE-36

*Note:* Draco will be booked for the duration of the Days, but if you would like to book a breakout room for your team, that's up to you.

## How

Propose a project and gather collaborators or join another team. Work as teams or individuals to complete your project or proposal in 24 hours. The core activity is expected to occur during normal work hours over a 24-hour span of time. Staff may stay a bit late if they choose, but please don’t pull an all nighter. Scope your plans with this time constraint in mind!


## Prizes

We will have an impartial judge and a small prize budget.

## Food / Snacks:

- Day 1: kickoff lunch, afternoon snacks :cookie:
- Day 2: lunch during presentations

## Ongoing Support

**There should be no expectation that any project or proposal completed during Serendipity Days will be launched into production or supported in any way.** Some may be very useful and thus justify productionizing via a small p-project proposal. Others may serve as proof of concepts for larger proposals. And of course some may be downright awful ideas and fail nice and fast in a single day.

## Notes

The projects really shouldn’t be worked on in advance or that defeats the purpose of the day a bit, so honor system is in play. However, if your idea will need data or server resources, feel free to work that out in advance. It’s appropriate to confirm you have access to an API and know how to access it, etc. Heroku and MIT OpenID Pilot are appropriate for this type of experimentation even if they may not be approved for a finalized version of the service.
