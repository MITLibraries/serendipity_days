# Summer 2017

## What

Let's take a day to work on something (useful) that is not currently getting attention but is in scope for what the libraries do (or should do). The definition of usefulness is intentionally vague. A 'useful' Slack bot script seems fair game, as does experimenting with Blacklight with some of our MARC records, or innovatively solving the presence problem (i.e. who is in CubeSpace today).


## When

[Help us pick a day!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPeyyJ803T2AiXyHKzEPko2hod29dYOL-B_V3-pS6Q-AKz5g/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Exact days to be determined based on the results of the linked survey, but it will be from 11am on a Thursday with lightning talk pitches of what people want to work on until 1pm on a Friday with lunchtime lightning talks of what was accomplished (successes, failures, doesn’t matter... presenting results is required).


## Who

ITDD for this initial test. If successful, inviting more people might be even better.


## Where

Cubespace!


## How

Propose a project and gather collaborators or join another team. Work as teams or individuals to complete your project in 24 hours. The core activity is expected to occur during normal work hours over a 24-hour span of time. Staff may stay a bit late if they choose, but please don’t pull an all nighter in Cubespace. Scope your projects with this time constraint in mind!


## Prizes

We will have an impartial judge and a small prize budget.


## Food / Snacks:
Day 1: kickoff lunch, afternoon snacks, and dinner (if you choose to stay late)

Day 2: light breakfast, lunch during presentations


## Ongoing Support

**There should be no expectation that any project completed during Serendipity Days will be launched into production or supported in any way.** Some may be very useful and thus justify productionizing via a small p-project proposal. Others may serve as proof of concepts for larger ITIG proposals. And of course some may be downright awful ideas and fail nice and fast in a single day.


## Notes

The projects really shouldn’t be worked on in advance or that defeats the purpose of the day a bit, so honor system is in play. However, if you are proposing a project that will need data or server resources work that out in advance. It’s appropriate to confirm you have access to an API and know how to access it, etc. Heroku and MIT OpenID Pilot are appropriate for this type of experimentation even if they may not be approved for a finalized version of the service.
