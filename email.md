Hi everybody!

It's that time again... What time, you ask? Serendipity Days are back! 

On November 5 and 6, let's take a day to work on something (useful) that is not currently getting attention but is in scope for what the libraries do (or should do). These Days are also an opportunity to work with colleagues you might not get to work with regularly. 

This year, we're introducing the possibility of working on project pitches instead of trying to knock out a bunch of code in a day. Spend the day working with peers to define a project proposal and pitch it at the end of the Days. Or write code. It's up to you! Some potential ideas for project areas could be on the topics of DISJ, Machine Learning, APIs, microdata, microformats, or something entirely different, but slack bots and metadata cleanup are still fair game. Get all the details:

Please join us! We'll have some fun.

ps. If you want to participate, block the time on your calendar. Renee will send an invite for the lunches so she can order enough food.
